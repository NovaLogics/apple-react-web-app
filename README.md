### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Add Custom Components  
- Create a new `components` folder inside the `src` directory.  
- Inside the `components` folder:  
  - Create a `Navbar.jsx` file.  
  - Create a `Hero.jsx` file.  
  - Create a `Highlights.jsx` file.  

ðŸ‘‰ [View the `src/components` folder](./src/components/)

**Note:**  
Install the `'ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets'` plugin.  
Using the `rafce` snippet will generate interactive component templates quickly.

#### 2. Import Component Files to `App.jsx`  
- Integrate the newly created components into `App.jsx`.  

ðŸ‘‰ [View the updated `App.jsx`](./src/App.jsx)

#### 4. Install GSAP for Animations

  ```bash
  npm install gsap @gsap/react
  ```

After installation, you can import the GSAP modules as follows:
